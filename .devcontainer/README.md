### DevContainer

In the folder .devcontainer you will find a devcontainer.json file for a [DevContainer](https://containers.dev/) which will provide several tools which are needed to participate in this hackerton.


You will need the following to work with DevContainer:
1. A working Container environment such as SuSE [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/)
2. An IDE with DevContainer-Support such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
    -> Install also the Dev Container Plugin in VS Code

Now 

So build (may take some minutes) and start the DevContainer you just need to click on this icon 


In the Terminal Window you will then be able to run the commands like pipx, docker, poetry etc. in a sh (e.g. bash or zsh)
