 Acceptance Criteria
Login screen should be displayed when the app opens, if the user is not already authenticated.

The login screen should have fields for username and password.

The “Login” button should remain disabled until both fields are filled.

If valid credentials are entered, the user should be logged in and redirected to the dashboard.

If invalid credentials are entered, an appropriate error message should be displayed.

Password input must be masked (i.e., characters are hidden).

There should be a “Show/Hide password” toggle next to the password field.

There should be a “Forgot Password” link, which opens the password recovery flow.

The login page should have basic input validation, e.g.:

Username must be an email

Password cannot be empty

Authentication requests should be secure (e.g., over HTTPS with proper error handling).

The app should remember logged-in users, and not ask for credentials again unless they log out or session expires.
