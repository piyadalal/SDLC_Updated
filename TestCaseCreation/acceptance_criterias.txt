1. Given a STB has booted with HYDE enabled and is connected to the internet, when the user tunes to an IP service that the user is not entitled and should be part of the DSU upgrade journey, then the relevant DSU banner should be shown (with the red upgrade button).
2. Given a STB has booted with HYDE enabled, when the user tunes midway through an appropriate event on an IP service that supports restart, then a Restart Banner will be shown shortly after tuning.

Notes:

Not all services can support restart.
Not all events (on a service that can support restart) support restart.
There is additional conditional business rules that relate to exactly when the Restart option is offered.
For instance, it is believed that restart is not shown if the user tunes to the event close the start of the event.
As a pre-requisite to tuning to an IP service, the user needs a functioning network connection.
