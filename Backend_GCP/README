Using Gemini 1.5 Pro which is a managed, pre-deployed model hosted by Google on Vertex AI.
You just call it directly via the SDK or API using its model name ("gemini-1.5-pro-preview").
Google handles the deployment, scaling, and infrastructure for you behind the scenes.
So the workflow is:
Initialize your Vertex AI client with your project and region.
Reference the pre-deployed model by name.
Send prompts and get responses — no deployment step needed on your end.
When would you deploy a model yourself?
If you trained a custom model (e.g., your own TensorFlow or PyTorch model).
Or if you want to deploy a custom container for inference.
